1. Download QuPath

    Download QuPath from the official GitHub page:
    https://github.com/qupath/qupath?tab=readme-ov-file

2. Open QuPath and Create a New Project

    Open QuPath.
    Go to Analysis pane > Project > Create project.
    Navigate to:
    Desktop > HOFI > 3181-64507 > 64507
    In this example:
	HOFI = Folder where I placed all birds we captured
        3181-64507 = Folder containing the images for a specific bird that I want to analyze.
        64507 = Empty folder where the QuPath project will be saved.

3. Add Images to Your Project

    Go to Analysis pane > Add images.
    Set the image type to one of the brightfield options.
        Note: Brightfield (other) ran fastest on my laptop.

    Choose the image location:
    Desktop > Example_HOFI > 3181-64507
    Select all the images you want to include.

4. Annotate the Images

    Go to Tools > Select shape type (e.g., Ellipse).
    Use the drawing tool to annotate over your image.

5. Export Annotation

    Go to File > Export as GeoJSON.
    Save with a preferred name (e.g., Circle.geojson)

6. Use Annotation in Script

    Go to Automate > Shared Script > New Script
    Insert code.
			
// Import Libraries
import qupath.lib.objects.PathObject
import qupath.lib.io.PathIO

// Define the File Path
def filePath = 'C:/Users/Xue/Desktop/HOFI/3181-64507/64507/Circle.geojson'

// Load the annotation to the from the GeoJSON file
def file = new File(filePath)
def annotations = PathIO.readObjects(file)

if (annotations != null && !annotations.isEmpty()) {
    def imageData = getCurrentImageData()
    annotations.each { annotation ->
        if (annotation instanceof PathObject) {
            imageData.getHierarchy().addObject(annotation)
        }
    }
    fireHierarchyUpdate()
    print 'Successful!'
} else {
    print 'Failed'
}

    Update the "Define the File Path" to your saved .geojson file.

    Example path:
    C:/Users/Xue/Desktop/HOFI/3181-64507/64507/Circle.geojson
    Run the script — your annotation should appear.

7. Run Cell Detection

    Go to Analyze > Cell Detection > Cell Detection
    Under Detection Image, choose either:
        Optical Density Sum or
        Hematoxylin OD 

    Under Intensity parameters, experiment with background radius, median filter radius and sigma,   
    Sometimes unchecking Split by shape may help depending on cell density
	Note: I like to start with 15/1/15 for these parameters then adjust from there. Values can be   
        increased or decreased 

    Adjust Nucleus Parameters (Min/Max area).
    To find Min/Max nucleus area:
        Use Tools > Wand or (W). You can click and fill in one or more nuclei. 
        Go to Annotations pane, click your annotation to view the values in the table.
        Note: I typically use a min of 600 and a max of 10,000

    Press Run after the necessary adjustments
        Annotations and the count should appear
	Note: Some cells may be counted more than once, I usually quickly go through and delete some so 	that it is only counted as one cell and not two. If it doesn't scan well, you can adjust the 
	parameters and run it again.

8. Manual Annotation

    Use Tools > Points or press (.) to manually mark cells.

    To name your annotations:
        Open the Annotations list (right panel).
        Right-click > Add/Remove names.
        Click your annotation and use Set selected to assign a name.

10. Save Project
    Go to File > Save.
    Or, when switching to a new image, QuPath will prompt you to save.
	Note: Images can be renamed in Image list by right clicking on the specified image.

Notes & Tips
    Script Reuse:
    The same script and cell detection settings can be reused for other images as long as the annotation 
    is in the same location and the image/staining quality is consistent. If the annotation location or    
    image quality differs, you may need to adjust accordingly.

    Annotation Requirement:
    The script is only used to manually add the annotation circle. You don’t have to use it, but an  	 
    annotation must be present on the image before running Cell Detection.

    Alternative Cell Counting Option:
    You can also use Analyze > Cell Detection > Fast cell counts (brightfield) to get similar results.
    Depending on the image and stain quality, Fast cell counts may perform better or worse than regular 
    Cell Detection—so it’s worth trying both. For Fast cell counts, the values I usually adjust are 
    Gaussian and Background
